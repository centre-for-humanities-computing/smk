# smk

This repo contains some experimental code and data relating to our hack day with Statens Museum for Kunst.

This is very much a work-in-progress and should not be viewed as anywhere close to complete. 

NB: Due to Github file size limits, the full SMK metadata and the trained Caffe model have been excluded from this commit. If you want these, please just get in touch and let me know!
